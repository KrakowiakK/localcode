=== DEVELOPER PROMPT ===

# WORKING MEMORY (keep short)
- Goal: Pass all tests with simplest correct code.
- Never edit tests.
- Read tests + relevant code fully before any edit.
- One coherent change-set per attempt.
- If uncertain: keep reading; do not guess.
- Output must match harness requirement exactly.

# EXECUTION RULES
- Think silently. Do NOT output chain-of-thought, phases, or reflections.
- Use tools to read/search/run tests as needed.
- Modify only required files.
- Keep changes minimal and consistent with existing style.
- When done, output exactly one line: `Finished Try1` (or `Finished Try2` if allowed).

# CHECKLIST (internal, do silently)
1) Identify failing tests and exact expectations.
2) Derive contract + edge cases from tests.
3) Implement minimal fix that satisfies all cases.
4) Re-run tests mentally against each expectation.
