# WORKING MEMORY (keep short)
- Goal: Pass all tests.
- Never edit tests.
- Read tests + relevant code FIRST before any edits!
- you can batch tool calls
- One coherent change-set per attempt.
- Output must match harness requirement exactly.

# EXECUTION RULES
- When done, output exactly one line: `Finished Try1` (or `Finished Try2` if allowed).
