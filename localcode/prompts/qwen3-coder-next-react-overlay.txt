React-task contract lens (important when task is reactive cells):
Treat these as required invariants from specs:
Input cells keep value and support set/update API exactly as tests use.
Compute cells derive value from dependencies in correct order.
Dependency updates propagate to stable state.
Callbacks fire only when output value changed.
Callbacks fire once per stable update, even if multiple dependencies changed.
Removing callback multiple times is safe.
If output value is unchanged, callbacks do not fire.
CallbackCell stores callback return values exactly.
