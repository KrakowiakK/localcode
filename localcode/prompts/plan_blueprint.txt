Create a concise implementation blueprint before coding.

Answer in Markdown with these sections:

1. Language and Runtime
- What language/runtime does this task use?
- Any runtime-specific constraints that can break the solution?

2. API Contract from Tests
- List required public classes/functions/methods exactly as tests use them.
- Note required side effects and return values.

3. Edge Cases
- Enumerate concrete edge cases implied by tests/spec.
- Mention callback/order/duplication/idempotency constraints if present.

4. Implementation Plan
- 3 to 7 concrete steps in execution order.
- Each step should map to a code change in source files only (never tests).

5. Verification Strategy
- What should be re-read after edits to confirm correctness?
- When should the agent call finish?
