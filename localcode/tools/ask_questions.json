Good questions are specific and actionable.\n\nExamples:\n- {{tool:ask_questions}}({\"questions\": [\"What edge cases do the tests check for?\", \"What data structure best fits this problem?\"]})\n- {{tool:ask_questions}}({\"questions\": [\"How should setValue propagate changes to dependents?\", \"What is the expected callback behavior on value change?\"]})",
