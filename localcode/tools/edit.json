    "old_equals_new": "ERROR: {{tool:edit}} called with 'old' identical to 'new' - no change would occur.\nThis usually means you want to MODIFY the code, not copy it unchanged.\nACTION:\n1. Re-read the file with {{tool:read}}({{target}})\n2. Identify the EXACT text you want to CHANGE (old)\n3. Write the MODIFIED version (new) - it must be DIFFERENT from old\n4. If the file already has correct content, the task may be complete - verify and move on.\nTIP: For small files, consider using {{tool:write}} to rewrite the entire file."
